      <h1>HTML HELP</h1>
      <h2>Making the Web accessible to all.</h2>
      <p><strong>Html Help</strong> was founded by <strong>Web Design Group</strong> to promote the
         creation of non-browser specific, non-resolution specific, creative and informative sites
         that are accessible to all users worldwide. To this end, the WDG offers material on a wide
         range of HTML related topics. We hope that with this site as a reference, you will be able
         to create Web sites that can be used by every person on the Internet, regardless of browser,
         platform, or settings.</p>
